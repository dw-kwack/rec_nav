A group in May 1889 represented life, the divine and the cycle of life while those from November 1889 arose out of his attempt to symbolize his feelings about Christ in Gethsemane. His paintings of olive pickers demonstrate the relationship between man and nature by depicting one of the cycles of life, harvesting or death. They also convey an example of how individuals, through communion with nature, can connect with the divine.Van Gogh found respite and relief in interaction with nature.

Mona Lisa,"(19.1962,24.94585,2.36763)","The Mona Lisa or Monna Lisa French: la Joconde is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci.

The painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo.It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel.Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family.It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.
The painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song ""Mona Lisa"" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.

For those Hindus who view Shiva to be the all-powerful creator divinity, he is responsible for both creation and destruction. The ring of fire and the tongue of flame he holds in his left hand refer to destruction, and the drum in his raised right hand refers to the relentless beat of time as it moves inevitably forward. His lower right hand, held up with the palm facing out, signals to his devotees not to be afraid of the impending destruction; they can be liberated from the cycles of birth and death through devotion to him, which he indicates by pointing to his upraised foot.
